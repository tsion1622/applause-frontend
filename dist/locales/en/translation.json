  "faq_q1": "How does the AI work?",
  "faq_a1": "Our platform uses a swarm of specialized AI agents. Each agent is an expert in a specific domain, like market analysis, design, or coding. They work together to build your app from the ground up, just like a human team would.",
  "faq_q2": "What do I get when I download my app?",
  "faq_a2": "You receive the complete source code for a native mobile application, built for the platform you selected (iOS or Android). This includes all the files you need to compile and submit your app to the app stores.",
  "faq_q3": "Can I really do this with no coding experience?",
  "faq_a3": "Absolutely! Our platform is designed for non-technical users. You provide your website URL and make some high-level choices, and our AI agents handle all the coding for you.",
  "faq_q4": "What if I want to make changes to my app after it's generated?",
  "faq_a4": "You own the source code, so you or a developer can make any changes you want. We are also working on a feature to allow you to make changes directly on our platform.",
  "faq_q5": "How long does it take to get my app?",
  "faq_a5": "The initial AI analysis and design phase takes just a few minutes. The full code generation can take a bit longer, but you'll have a complete, ready-to-use app in a fraction of the time it would take to build one traditionally.",
  "faq_q6": "Is my app unique?",
  "faq_a6": "Yes. While our AI uses best practices and pre-defined architectures, the final app is tailored to your brand, content, and the user persona generated from your website.",
  "faq_q7": "What if I need help?",
  "faq_a7": "We have a dedicated support team ready to assist you. You can reach out to us via the chat on our platform or by emailing support@applaude.ai."
